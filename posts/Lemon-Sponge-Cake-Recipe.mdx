## The Zesty Magic of Lemon

The vibrant flavor of lemon is like a burst of sunshine in every bite. It's no wonder this citrus fruit is a beloved ingredient in both sweet and savory dishes. In our Lemon Sponge Cake, the lemony zing takes center stage, making it the perfect dessert for any occasion.

## Ingredients

**For the Cake:**

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ tsp baking powder
- ¼ tsp salt
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 4 large eggs
- Zest of 2 lemons
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- ½ cup unsalted butter, melted
- ½ cup whole milk

**For the Lemon Syrup:**

- ¼ cup lemon juice
- ¼ cup granulated sugar

**For the Lemon Glaze:**

- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 2-3 tbsp lemon juice
- Lemon zest for garnish

## Instructions

### 1. Preheat and Prepare

- Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour an 8-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper.

### 2. Whisk the Dry Ingredients

- In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set it aside.

### 3. Beat Sugar and Eggs

- In a separate bowl, beat the sugar and eggs until the mixture is light and fluffy.

### 4. Add Lemon Zest and Juice

- Stir in the lemon zest and lemon juice.

### 5. Melt Butter

- Melt the butter and let it cool slightly.

### 6. Combine Wet and Dry

- Gradually add the melted butter to the egg mixture while continuously mixing.

### 7. Add Dry Ingredients

- Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients.

### 8. Bake

- Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center.

### 9. Prepare Lemon Syrup

- While the cake is baking, prepare the lemon syrup. In a small saucepan, heat the lemon juice and sugar until the sugar dissolves. Let it cool.

### 10. Soak the Cake

- Once the cake is out of the oven, use a toothpick to poke holes all over the cake. Pour the lemon syrup over the warm cake, allowing it to soak in.

### 11. Make the Lemon Glaze

- To prepare the lemon glaze, mix powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth. Adjust the consistency by adding more sugar or juice as needed.

### 12. Drizzle and Garnish

- Drizzle the lemon glaze over the cake, allowing it to drip down the sides. Garnish with lemon zest for a fresh look.
